 */

/**
 *
 *
 * - Create a set sptSet (shortest path tree set) that keeps track of vertices included in the shortest path tree,
 *   i.e., whose minimum distance from the source is calculated and finalized. Initially, this set is empty.
 * - Assign a distance value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all distance values as INFINITE.
 *   Assign the distance value as 0 for the source edges_u so that it is picked first.
 * -  While  sptSet  doesnâ€™t include all vertices
 *  - Pick a edges_u  u  that is not there in  sptSet  and has a minimum distance value.
 *  - Include u to  sptSet.
 *  - Then update the distance value of all adjacent vertices of  u.
 *     Iterate through all adjacent and for  every adjacent  v,
 *     if the sum of the distance value of  u  (from source) and weight of edge  u-v,
 *     is less than the distance value of  v,
 *     then update the distance value of  v.
